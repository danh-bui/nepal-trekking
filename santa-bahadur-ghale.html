            During our trek Santa took a great care of us and found solutions to each and every difficulty we faced. I will be more than happy to do more treks with Santa, a guide that I will always remember."

Our guide/touristrelationship rapidly became a real friendship. Santa's discretion, sensitivity, his constant good nature and sense of humor make him an outstanding companion and we had lots of interesting conversations. Thanks to Santa, I got an great opportunity to approach the Nepali culture and better understand his country."
